It seems like everyone in the tech industry goes through a blogging phase. This is the beginning of mine.

&nbsp;<br/>
## What's the blog about?

Inspired by my guiding principle of _"I want to do cool things"_ this blog will cover mostly personal reflections about big ideas.

I'll try to publish posts that will remain relevant and valuable over a long period of time. I want to address questions or issues that are unlikely to become outdated anytime soon. For this reason and to keep the writing quality high, the publishing rate will be very low.

You can consider this blog as a Garden, in the spirit of ["The Garden and the Stream: A Technopastoral"](https://hapgood.us/2015/10/17/the-garden-and-the-stream-a-technopastoral/). Here articles aren't set in stone, but grow and evolve as topics demand new insights or updates.

You can track all edits on the [blog's GitHub folder](https://github.com/francescobarbieri/barbierinotes).

## Why a blog?

Blogging can play a crucial role in exploring and, more importantly, sharing ideas that hopefully will ignite some debates, wich are the mechanism for society to self-correct, innovate and evolve. 

If you ever want to reach out to me, you can do so on [ùïè](https://twitter.com/barbierinotes). My DMs and the reply section are always open for an interesting chat.

I would like to give credit to the article ["You should write blogs"](https://sites.google.com/site/steveyegge2/you-should-write-blogs?authuser=0) by Steve Yegge, and many of [Paul Graham](https://www.paulgraham.com/)'s essays, which withouth them probably this blog wouldn't exists.

## Why your website is so minimal?

There's something about the old websites that I've always found compelling: the elegance of simplicity. As I was thinking about the what's the best direction for my own site, I couldn't help but ask myself if I should follow the modern trend. The answer was a resounding 'no'.

In this current era, websites are bloated. They're loaded with frameworks, libraries, animations, and images that serve more to dazzle than to deliver. It's far from the web's initial principles, a shift that feels less like progress and more like excess for the sake of excess.

For these reasons, I decided to adopt a content-first approach for my website, where trendy elements that lose appeal quickly won't be rendered on your screen.

As a collateral benefit, this blog has proudly joined the [512kb Club](https://512kb.club/) and (obviously) the [1MB Club](https://1mb.club/), a collection of high-performance, optimized websites.

## Why no dark mode?

Maybe it will come in a future update, but for now I like a clean and light theme.
